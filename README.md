# Sneaker-Website
Sneaker Website created as a project to develop my skills in HTML and CSS. 

# How to operate
To get a copy of the website download the repository as a zip file and extract it to a location of your choosing. Then open index.html in your browser to view the website or open any of the html or css files in a text editor to view the source code.

The main code is index.html. Open index.html first to pop up a display page for the website, from there you can navigate the links in the bar up top.

If you want to view individual pages without the main display, click on products.html for a list of products, cart.html to view the cart, and watchlist.html to view the watchlist.
